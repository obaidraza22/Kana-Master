# 🎌 Kana Master

A simple and visually pleasing React app built to help users explore **Hiragana** and **Katakana**, the core components of the Japanese writing system.

> ❗️**Note:**
> This app was created by me as a way to practice **React Router**, **useContext**, and **useReducer**.
> It is not designed to teach Japanese.
> If you're serious about learning kana, there are many dedicated resources and apps built specifically for that purpose.
